👉 These are **next-level problems** that feel like “level-up++” because:

* Many combine **multiple data structures** (Trie + Backtracking, Heap + Greedy, DP + Graph).
* They involve **optimization / binary search on answer**.
* They’re asked heavily in **FAANG + product-based interviews**.

Would you like me to **make this into a proper Excel-style table** (like your original one → classified by DS & pattern, with difficulty & company tags), so you can track progress?
