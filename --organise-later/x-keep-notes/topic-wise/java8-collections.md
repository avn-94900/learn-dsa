# Java 8 & Collections

### Collections & Data Structures

| Number | Question |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 1 | Difference between `Map`, `Set` and `List`. Tell their time complexity as well |
| 2 | Arrays problem: `{1, 5, 6, 5, 5, 8, 2, 2}` - using Java Streams return unique numbers in ascending order, then descending order |
| 3 | Group employees by department and get average salary using Java 8 with best time complexity |
| 4 | Return second highest salary from list of integers using Java 8 |
| 5 | Do we store hashcode in bucket? (HashMap Internals) |
